# 10-Years-of-Steam
In this project I analyze 10 years of the steam gaming platform. The aim of the project is to find what makes a great game. We will look at price strategies, genres, publishers and developers to find out what factors lead to a game having better engagement(total downloads), quality(rating) & player retention(average playtime). The big question we will try to answer after the analysis is: What makes a game successful? 

The project is divided in two parts:
- In the first part I clean the original dataset. This dataset is publicly available in Kaggle(link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games). The original state of the data was not very useful. We had missing values & columns with bad formatting.
- In the second part of the project I analyze all the data to try to answer the question of what makes a game successfull.
